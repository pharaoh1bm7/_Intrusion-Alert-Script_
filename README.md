# Intrusion Alert Script

🚨 **Lightweight Network Intrusion Detection & Alerting Tool**

A Python-based script designed to monitor network activity, detect suspicious behavior (such as DoS/DDoS patterns), and alert the administrator in real time.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to provide a **simple yet extensible intrusion detection mechanism** suitable for learning, experimentation, and small-scale monitoring.

It focuses on:
- Detecting abnormal traffic behavior
- Raising alerts when potential attacks are identified
- Helping beginners understand IDS concepts عمليًا

---

## ✨ Features

- 📡 Network traffic monitoring  
- 🛡️ Detection of abnormal request rates  
- 🚨 Real-time alert (popup / console-based)  
- 🧩 Easy-to-extend detection logic  
- 🐍 Written in Python for simplicity and clarity  

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```

*Intrusion-Alert-Script*/
│
├─ plugin.py        # Main intrusion detection script
├─ README.md        # Project documentation
└─ docs/            # Additional documentation (optional)

````

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts  

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pharaoh1bm7/_Intrusion-Alert-Script_.git
cd _Intrusion-Alert-Script_
````

2. Run the script:

```bash
python3 plugin.py
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

The script analyzes network-related data and checks for:

* Sudden spikes in traffic
* Unusual request behavior
* Patterns that may indicate DoS/DDoS attacks

⚠️ **Note:**
This is an educational project and not a replacement for enterprise-grade IDS solutions like Snort or Suricata.

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

* Learning Intrusion Detection basics
* Security awareness & training
* Proof-of-concept IDS development
* Academic or personal security projects

---

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome!
If you want to improve detection logic, add logging, or enhance alerts:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch
3. Submit a Pull Request

### الخطوة الجاية المقترحة 👇  
- بعد ما ترفع README  
- نضيف **CONTRIBUTING.md + LICENSE**  
- وبعدين نخليه **IDS Project منظم** يليق باسمك كباحث أمني وقائد مشروع

لما تخلص رفعه قولي  
**نكمل إيه بعد كده؟**
